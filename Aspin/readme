Main and makefile:
main.cpp.f90          Main program.
Makefile              Makefile.

Subroutines:
close_coupling.f90    It manages the two kind of propagation
                      schemes: pure LogD/combined LogD-VP.
logd.f90              Pure LogD propagation.
logdvp.f90            Combined LogD-VP propagation. 
var_ph.f90            VP propagator.
daprop_lr.f90         Propagator used in some special cases of var_ph.f90. 
derivs.f90            Right-hand side of the VP equation.
derivs1.f90           Right-hand side of the VP equation.
lib.f                 Set of subroutines.
vfitt.f90             Potential subroutine. 
vpot.f90              It calculates the potential at each point.
common_blocks.f90     Constants and shared memory blocks.

Output codes:
serial.f90            Serial main code from main.cpp.f90. 
parallel.f90          Parallel main code from main.cpp.f90. 

File needed if parallelized:
mpif.h              Header for the MPI formulation.

This code works under f90 in serial or parallel mode.
You have to write the right compiler in the Makefile
taking account that in your machine.
For using the code:

A) Serial:

First, delete some files that can cause problems: 
>make clean

Second, compile the code:
>make serial

The output of this order is "cc.exe". Once you have
cc.exe launch it in the next way:
>./cc.exe < input > out&

B) Parallel:

First, delete some files that can cause problems:
>make clean

Second, compile de code:
>make parallel

The output of this order is "cc_mpi.exe". Once you have
cc_mpi.exe launch it in the right way. For instance,
in an AMD OPTERON COMPUTING SYSTEMS with SuSE LINUX 
PROFESSIONAL 9 computer it would be:
>mpirun cc_mpi.exe < input > out&
