INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION OF FERM3D:

Three different installing scripts are provided: 
a) one oriented to Intel compilers (file "install.adv.pl.Intel")
(and Intel or AMD architectures, the code has been tested on Xeon 32-bit
machines and Opteron 64-bit machines running Linux),
with all the libraries (ARPACK, CERNLIB) installed (this script installs also the post-processing R_mat_post_proc.x), 
b) the second for Tru64 (file "install.adv.pl.Tru64") (tested on a HP Alpha machine with the HP Fortran
compiler) without those libraries.
c) the third again for Tru64 (file "install.adv.pl.Tru64.SuperLU") (tested on a HP Alpha machine with the HP Fortran
compiler) using SuperLU instead of Pardiso (good for commercial applications) without the optional libraries.


====================================================================================================================

LIBRARIES: 
	LAPACK/BLAS have to be installed ALWAYS.
	The PARDISO (or in alternative SuperLU) library needs to be installed ALWAYS, since without it the code
		will not work on any platform.
	ARPACK does not need to be installed all the time, see notes below,
	CERNLIB (in particular its WCLBES routine) needs to be installed only
		if post processing code is needed (again see notes below)
	Libraries from Computer Physics Communications: ADDA is already
		included in distribuion, ACDP is superseded by CERNLIB (that provides the same routine updated, 
		since ADCP does not work on Intel compilers) and it is therefore not needed.

====================================================================================================================

If using the second script (for Tru64), to install CM.x one needs to "cd ../utils_dipole"
and "make CM.x".

In the following we will call <FERM3D-dir> the root directory of the package (the one with make/ src/ lib/ directories).

The installing scripts are "install.adv.pl<system>" (<system> is either Intel
or Tru64 depending on which system one wants to install the program on, see
also notes above). The installing scripts generate all the files needed for
compilation and installing.

To install:

1) Install all the required libraries
2) cd to <FERM3D-dir>/make
3) change the location of the compiler and libraries in "install.adv.pl<system>" (defined
	at beginning of script)
4) run the install.adv.pl<system> Perl script:
	perl  install.adv.pl<system>
	all the binaries will be in the <FERM3D-dir>/bin/ directory


====================================================================================================================

NOTES:
	The PARDISO library must be installed ( see http://www.computational.unibas.ch/cs/scicomp/software/pardiso/ 
		for download, installation and  information consult the
		documentation if having problems with linking)
	In alternative to Pardiso, SuperLU can be installed (see http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/ for downloads and details)
		IMPORTANT: We have interfaced the code to version 2.0 of this library. If using newer versions, 
		the file src/SuperLUCustom/dSLUsolve.c will have to be changed.
 	the variable $LAPACK is used for linking the Lapack/Blas libraries and the pardiso/superlu solver as well,
		on an Intel machine it will look like: 
		$LAPACK='-L<Path to mkl libs> -L/usr/lib64 -lguide -lmkl_solver -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_em64t -lpthread -Vaxlib'
		and on a Tru64: 
		$LAPACK='-L<Path to Pardiso> -lpardiso_TRU64 -lcxml'
		or, if using SuperLU
		$LAPACK='-L<Path to SuperLU> -lcxml'
	the variable "PARDISOLIB" should point to the location of the pardiso library file:
		PARDISOLIB='<Path to pardiso>/<name of library file>'
		if using SuperLU, set PARDISOLIB='' 
	if using SUPERLU, SUPERLU_SOURCE='Path to SuperLU source code', 
		otherwise SUPERLU_SOURCE='' 
	if ARPACK is not present: set $ARPACK='' 
		Otherwise $ARPACK='<Path to ARPACK/Library name>' (or however it is linked on that specific system)
	if CERNLIB does not exist: set $CERNLIB=''
		otherwise $CERNLIB='<Path to CERNLIB/Library name>' (or however it is linked on that specific system)
	set $THR to the number of processors (if shared memory machine), usually $THR=1

	The post processing module is installed automatically by the Intel
	script but not by the Tru64 script, to install it in that case, install
	CERNLIB, then uncomment the last line of the Tru64 install script.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES:

The examples are in the "examples" directory. Three are given: CO2 neutral
(elastic scattering), CO2+ (photoionization) and benzene (elastic scattering).
The input and output files are in the "examples" directory and are named as
specified in the CPC article. 

IMPORTANT: The grids have already generated, so running CM.x  can be skipped.

1) Neutral system: 
cd to <FERM3D-dir>/examples/neutral
Generate the potential files from Gaussian: 
	a) run the script "co2.potential.inp" using Gaussian 
	OR
	b) pick the potential files at:
	http://fermion.colorado.edu/~tonzani/Software/rmatrix/Software.html ("files for CPC neutral calculation" link)
Generate the grid:
	run CM.x: <FERM3D-dir>/bin/CM.x 
		mv fort.16 input_grid.dat
Run the code:
        <FERM3D-dir>/bin/FERM3D.x
Run the post processing if needed
        <FERM3D-dir>/bin/R_mat_post_proc.x

2) ionic system:
cd to <FERM3D-dir>/examples/ion
Generate the potential files and initial molecular orbitals from Gaussian:
        a) run the scripts "co2.potential.inp" and "co2.plus.MO.inp" using Gaussian
        OR
        b) pick the potential files at:
        http://fermion.colorado.edu/~tonzani/Software/rmatrix/Software.html ("files for CPC ion calculation" link)

        run CM.x: <FERM3D-dir>/bin/CM.x
		mv fort.16 input_grid.dat
Run the code:
        <FERM3D-dir>/bin/FERM3D.x

3) benzene:
cd to <FERM3D-dir>/examples/benzene
