in order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT:
benzene.cube.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

OUTPUT:
fort.800 contains elastic scattering cross section
