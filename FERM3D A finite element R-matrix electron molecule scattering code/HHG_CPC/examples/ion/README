In order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT
co2.plus.MO.inp  : Gaussian98 script to get Molecular orbitals for
photoionization
co2.plus.potential.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

PC-Gamess input: potentials.inp.6-31gS.gamess for density and potential	
		orbitals.inp.6-31g.??.gamess for the various initial orbitals 
IMPORTANT: The results in the paper have been obtained with potentials from
Gaussian98, if using PC-Gamess they will differ slightly.

OUTPUT:
fort.951: photoionization cross section from last pi_u orbital
fort.952: photoionization cross section from last sigma_g orbital
fort.953: photoionization cross section from last pi_g orbital
output.txt: complete output of the code
