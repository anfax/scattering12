EXAMPLES:

===============================================================================

CO2 neutral:

directory "neutral"

In order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT:
co2.potential.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

OUTPUT:
fort.950 contains elastic scattering cross section

===============================================================================
CO2+

directory "ion"

In order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT
co2.plus.MO.inp  : Gaussian98 script to get Molecular orbitals for
photoionization
co2.plus.potential.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

OUTPUT:
fort.951: photoionization cross section from last pi_u orbital
fort.952: photoionization cross section from last sigma_g orbital
fort.953: photoionization cross section from last pi_g orbital

===============================================================================
Benzene

directory "benzene"


in order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT:
benzene.cube.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

OUTPUT:
fort.800 contains elastic scattering cross section

A sample run perl script is given to understand what the steps are in a typical
calculation.
