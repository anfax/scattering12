In order to run the examples is needed to run CM.x for each of them and to get
potentials from gaussian

INPUT:
co2.potential.inp : Gaussian98 script to obtain density, gradient,
laplacian and electrostatic potential
input_grid.dat: grid used to generate output (slightly corrected around the
nuclei from CM.x output)

PC-Gamess input: potentials.inp.6-31gS.gamess for density and potential
		

OUTPUT:
fort.950 contains elastic scattering cross section, output.txt contains the
full program output
