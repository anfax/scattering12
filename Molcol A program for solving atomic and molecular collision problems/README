The programs molcol.f and cpot.f (which is "included") are compiled and linked
with the Lapack and Blas libraries, whose matrix multiplication and inversion
routines are used, by means of

f77 -O -o molcol.ex molcol.f -L/usr/local/lib -llapack -lblas

on an IBM RS6000 processor; the equivalent library or libraries must be used on
different computer architectures.

The input files molcol.dat1 and molcol.dat2 must be provided. Output is to
molcol.out.
Sample input files and cpot routines are supplied for the O - H2 and He -
H2 systems
(see the Long Writeup).
